# 0022 — Pipes & Filters Conventions — telemetry-pipeline

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-17

---

## Context

ADR-0001 assigns `telemetry-pipeline` the Pipes & Filters style; ADR-0019 pins the
wiring (`@Bean Function<>`). Without filter-level conventions, a stream pipeline
silently degrades into "tangled Kafka consumers": mutable shared state, side-effects
that depend on ordering, god-DTOs that grow ad-hoc fields per stage.

---

## Decision

1. **A filter is `java.util.function.Function<IN, OUT>`** — no custom `Filter`
   interface. Composition is `f1.andThen(f2)`.
2. **`null` return = drop.** Spring Cloud Stream skips publishing on `null`. Do not
   throw to filter (throwing triggers a retry — ADR-0016 — which is for failures, not
   rejection).
3. **Filters are stateless** — constructor takes config + observability handles; no
   mutated fields. **The one exception is `AggregationFilter`,** which holds a bounded,
   self-expiring `ConcurrentMap<String, WindowState>` (Welford's algorithm). Any other
   stateful filter requires a new ADR.
4. **Messages are records, growing monotonically:**
   `RawTelemetry → ValidatedTelemetry → EnrichedTelemetry → AggregatedTelemetry →
   AnomalyAlert`. New stage = new record. Never mutate or reuse an upstream type.
5. **Side effects stay at the edges.** The terminal `Function` return is published by
   the binder; no filter calls Kafka or DB directly. No persistence layer here
   (ADR-0018).
6. **Every filter emits Micrometer counters** with low-cardinality labels (ADR-0005).
   High-cardinality data (`shipId`, `alertId`) goes in trace baggage (ADR-0017).

Composition uses an explicit lambda over `andThen` so the null short-circuit is
visible:

```java
return raw -> {
    ValidatedTelemetry v = validation.apply(raw);
    if (v == null) return null;
    EnrichedTelemetry e = enrichment.apply(v);
    AggregatedTelemetry a = aggregation.apply(e);
    return anomaly.apply(a);   // null → no alert published
};
```

## Why

- **Every stage is unit-testable** with a plain `Function` + `SimpleMeterRegistry`.
- **Topology changes are local** — new filter = new class + one composition edit.
- **Typed records catch contract drift at compile time** — no god-DTO with mostly-null
  fields.
- **Null-as-drop is cheap** — no exceptions for legitimate filtering.
- **`ConcurrentMap` over `synchronized`** in `AggregationFilter` avoids pinning carrier
  threads under virtual threads (ADR-0012).

---

## Known gaps

- Null contract is not statically enforced (no `JSpecify` yet).
- No back-pressure inside the lambda — all stages run lockstep on one consumer thread.
  Per-stage executor is a later option.
- Aggregation state is in-process; lost on restart / rebalance. Fine for alerting, not
  for billing.

---

## Alternatives

- **Custom `Filter<IN, OUT>` interface** — invites a "pipeline context" param that
  destroys composability.
- **Kafka Streams DSL** — more powerful (rocksdb state, interactive queries); overkill
  while state fits in memory.
- **Reactor `Flux<>` in a `Function`** — conflicts with binder default binding
  semantics; complicates tests.
- **Rich god-DTO carrying all fields** — contracts degrade to documentation.
- **Publishing from inside a filter** — destroys replay and testability; alerts leave
  via a downstream consumer on `telemetry.alerts`.
